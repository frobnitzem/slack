SLACK: Standard Linear Array Computation Kernels

  Got a large tensor algebra problem? Don't panic.
This library provides a multi-level interface to high-performance
linear array computations.

Dependencies for generated kernels in gen/:

 1. CUDA developer kit version 5 or above & GPU for program execution.
   - Which itself requires GCC.
 2. Python 2.4 or above (code generators).

Dependencies for LaTeX to tensor exection engine (slack.c):
 1. Flex/Bison lexer and parser.
 2. QUARK scheduling library (see Makefile)
 * non-quark, serial version also not yet implemented
 * StarPU distributed task scheduling framework backend is incomplete

Recommended:
 * A LaTeX distribution for typesetting.
 * graphviz and inkscape for drawing pretty graphs (slack -v)
   (actual command in print_dot.c is "dot -Tsvg -o %s.svg %s && inkview %s.svg")

Running slack (no installation yet):
 1. Edit Makefile
 2. run make
 3. run bin/slack -v examples/singles.tex
 - or -
 3. reference "include/slack.h" and link against lib/libslack.a
    in your own code.
   * See examples in bin/*.c and examples/*.tex
