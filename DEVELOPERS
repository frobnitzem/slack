Coding conventions:

 1. I am the code thou art currently developing, and thou shalt put no
    conflicting dependencies before me.
 2. Thou shalt not break the build - lest thy jobs crash
    down upon thee whilst thou sleepest.
 3. Thou shalt not create a framework without at least
    three inhabitants.  Three shall be the number of the count.
 4. Thou art charged to cast out the malevolent global variables
    wherever they are to be found.  The exceptions are those
    variables associated with the main function and its host.
 5. Thou shalt not needlessly proliferate arguments to functions
    where struct will do.
    Neither shalt thou covet the needlessly complicated
    data structures of object oriented code.
 6. Thou art cautioned to use the one true brace style,
    lest thy colleagues profane thee behind thy back.
